# Predicting_Diamond_Prices
## Predicitve Analytics for Business (Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship)
## Project Description
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, in this project I have used the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds. Every file and code for this project is found on my Github repository attached above on project URL section.

## Project Details
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, the companyâ€™s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. You, as the business analysts, are tasked to apply that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.
